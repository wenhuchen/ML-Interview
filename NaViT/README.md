# NaViT - Native Resolution Vision Transformer

This directory demonstrates NaViT (Native Resolution Vision Transformer) concepts through the implementation of Idefics2, a multimodal model that processes images at their native resolutions without fixed-size constraints.

## Overview

Traditional Vision Transformers require images to be resized to a fixed resolution (e.g., 224Ã—224), which can distort aspect ratios and lose important visual information. NaViT enables processing images at their native resolutions while maintaining computational efficiency, leading to better performance on vision tasks.

Contains the implementation of Idefics2, which incorporates NaViT-inspired concepts for handling variable-resolution images.

## Core Concepts

### Native Resolution Processing
**Preserving Original Image Information**

Traditional ViT approach:
```python
# Fixed resize - loses aspect ratio and detail
image = resize(image, (224, 224))
patches = split_into_patches(image, 16)  # Always 196 patches
```

NaViT/Idefics2 approach:
```python
# Preserve native resolution and aspect ratio
patches = adaptive_patching(image, target_patch_size=16)  # Variable number of patches
# Handle variable sequence lengths efficiently
```

**Key Advantages:**
- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: No distortion from forced resizing
- **Detail Retention**: High-resolution images keep fine-grained information
- **Efficiency**: Smaller images require less computation
- **Flexibility**: Single model handles multiple resolutions

### Variable-Length Sequence Handling
**Dynamic Attention and Processing**

NaViT innovations for handling variable patch counts:

1. **Factorized Positional Encoding**: Separate encoding for height and width dimensions
2. **Masked Attention**: Efficient handling of variable-length sequences in batches
3. **Resolution-Aware Pooling**: Adaptive pooling strategies for different resolutions
4. **Packing Strategies**: Efficient batching of images with different patch counts

## Implementation Analysis

### Image Processing Pipeline
**From Raw Image to Model Input**

The implementation demonstrates key steps:

```python
# 1. Load and preprocess image
image = Image.open('dog.jpg')  # Native resolution preserved

# 2. Processor handles variable resolution
inputs = processor(images=[image], text='Add a caption <image>', return_tensors="pt")

# 3. Extract and visualize processed patches
for i, image_tensor in enumerate(inputs['pixel_values'][0]):
    # Denormalize: (tensor * std) + mean
    original_tensor = (tensor * std) + mean
    # Convert back to viewable image
    original_image = tensor.permute(1, 2, 0).numpy()
```

### Multimodal Integration
**Vision-Language Understanding**

The Idefics2 model demonstrates:
- **Cross-Modal Attention**: Image patches attend to text tokens and vice versa
- **Interleaved Processing**: Text and images processed in unified sequence
- **Contextual Generation**: Image understanding conditioned on textual context

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Patch Management
**Efficient Variable-Resolution Processing**

Key innovations in handling different image sizes:

1. **Adaptive Tokenization**: Number of visual tokens varies with image resolution
2. **Attention Scaling**: Computational complexity adapts to actual content
3. **Memory Efficiency**: No wasted computation on padding tokens
4. **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of mixed-resolution batches

### Resolution-Aware Architecture
**Model Components Optimized for Variable Input**

- **Flexible Position Encoding**: 2D positional embeddings that scale to any resolution
- **Dynamic Attention Patterns**: Attention mechanisms that adapt to sequence length
- **Resolution-Conditional Processing**: Model behavior adapts based on input resolution
- **Multi-Scale Feature Extraction**: Hierarchical processing of different resolution levels

## Running the Code

### Basic Image Captioning:
```python
python run.py
```

**Process Flow:**
1. **Image Loading**: Loads 'dog.jpg' at native resolution
2. **Processing**: Converts to model input format preserving resolution
3. **Visualization**: Saves processed image patches to understand preprocessing
4. **Inference**: Generates caption using vision-language model
5. **Output**: Displays generated caption for the input image

### Requirements:
- **Transformers Library**: Latest version with Idefics2 support
- **PIL/Pillow**: Image loading and manipulation
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **GPU**: Recommended for model inference (8B parameter model)

### Expected Output:
```
# Model generates contextual caption
"A [detailed description of the image content]"
```

## NaViT vs Traditional ViT

### Traditional ViT Limitations
- **Fixed Resolution**: All images resized to same dimensions
- **Aspect Ratio Distortion**: Square patches from rectangular images
- **Information Loss**: Downsampling loses fine details
- **Inefficiency**: Small images processed at unnecessarily high resolution

### NaViT Advantages
- **Native Resolution**: Process images at original dimensions
- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Maintains image geometry
- **Detail Retention**: No unnecessary downsampling
- **Computational Efficiency**: Processing scales with actual image size
- **Better Performance**: Improved accuracy on vision tasks
